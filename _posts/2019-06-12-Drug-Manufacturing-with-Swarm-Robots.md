This project was done at the [Little Devices Lab](http://littledevices.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at MIT. Many labor intensive biological assay operations are conducted by expensive industrial robots. These large scale robots operate rigidly in a pre-programmed fashion and require a lot of hand-engineering for each experiment. Swarm robotics offer a cheaper, more flexible approach to assay automation. This project involved building out the existing platforms capabilities in a couple of different ways. The first was developing a simulation environment in order to study the longterm convergence of different swarm behavioral protocols. The second was implementing a tracking system in order to record and measure the systems performance on a real experiment. Lastly, I contributed to the general design of the robot hardware and systems level code. A picture of the swarm robots from 2018 is below.
