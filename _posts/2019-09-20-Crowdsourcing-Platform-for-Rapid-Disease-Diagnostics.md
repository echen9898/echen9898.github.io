This project was done at the [Little Devices Lab](http://littledevices.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at MIT. Rapid tests exist for pregnancies, but are difficult to come by cheaply and efficiently for new diseases. This platform uses the Little Devices Lab's ampli blocks to run rapid tests cheaply on paper. A raspberry pi zero and a camera are used to take a picture of the testing lanes, and deliver a diagnostic based on a cloud hosted classifier. This classifier is trained using crowdsourced data from the same system. The ceiling is lit with LED's that are optimally placed to ensure even lighting across the entire test surface, and the system is boxed to provide the best quality picture. The entire system is 3D printable, or can be cheaply shipped in a manilla envelope.
