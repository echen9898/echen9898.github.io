This project was done at the [Little Devices Lab](http://littledevices.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at MIT. Patient monitors are used to track and display a variety of metrics in hospitals in order to ensure high quality care. To extract records of this data for important analysis, hospitals are often forced to pay extra fees to manufacturers. For many hospitals around the world, these fees represent a difficult extra barrier to providing care. This software is an open source optical character recognition tool that can be used to extract data from a patient monitor with a webcam. It works on a variety of different monitors with varying font styles and colors. A word of caution, this algorithm been tested on a limited subset of monitor types and webcam qualities. While the webcams used for testing were pretty low quality, anyone looking to use this should make sure to test it on their own hardware at length.
