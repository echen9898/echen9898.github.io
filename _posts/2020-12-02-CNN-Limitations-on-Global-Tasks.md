[6.860 (Statistical Learning Theory)](https://cbmm.mit.edu/9-520){:target="_blank"} is a graduate class at MIT taught by Prof. Poggio that explores recent advances in statistical machine learning theory. For the final project, I am working with postdoc [Arturo Deza](https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/deza){:target="_blank"} and first year PhD [Romain Cosson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-cosson-6246b6150/){:target="_blank"} on extending the intuition behind results uncovered in [recent research](https://cbmm.mit.edu/publications/hierarchically-local-tasks-and-deep-convolutional-networks){:target="_blank"}. Project is ongoing.
